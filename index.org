I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at University of Geneva, working under the mentorship of [[https://www.unige.ch/~doussej/][Jehanne Dousse]].
I completed my Ph.D. at Sungkyunkwan University under the supervision of [[https://jangsookim.github.io/][Jang Soo Kim]].
My research interests lie in algebraic combinatorics and enumerative combinatorics.
