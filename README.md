# Jihyeug Jang
I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at University of Geneva, working under the mentorship of [Jehanne Dousse](https://www.unige.ch/~doussej/). 
I completed my Ph.D. at Sungkyunkwan University under the supervision of [Jang Soo Kim](https://jangsookim.github.io/). 
My research interests lie in algebraic combinatorics and enumerative combinatorics.
